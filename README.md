Assignment Web Application

This repository contains the code for my submission to the assignment that requires building a web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The assignment specifications include implementing various functionalities as shown in the provided design and ensuring thorough testing and documentation.

*Key Features*:
User authentication
Data input and validation.
Responsive design for mobile and desktop

*Technologies Used*:
HTML5
CSS3 (for styling)
JavaScript 
Git for version control

*Instructions*:
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Open the index.html file in your web browser to view the web application.
Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the application and test its functionalities.

*Assumptions*:
Users are expected to enter numeric values only in the input fields for gross annual income, extra income, and deductions.
Age is selected from a dropdown menu with three options: <40, ≥ 40 & < 60, and ≥ 60.
The tax calculation formula provided is accurate and does not need to be adjusted.
Error icons and tooltips are only displayed when there are input validation errors or when the age group is not selected.
The modal displaying the final tax calculation is a simple popup modal and does not require any advanced features.

*Challenges Faced*:
Implementing error handling and validation for input fields while ensuring a smooth user experience was challenging, especially with the requirement to display error icons and tooltips dynamically.
Calculating tax based on age groups and applying different tax rates posed a challenge in terms of implementing the logic correctly and efficiently.
Ensuring cross-browser compatibility and responsiveness of the web application across different devices and screen sizes required careful testing and adjustments to the CSS styling and layout.

*Note*:
This project is for demonstration purposes only and may not be suitable for production use.
